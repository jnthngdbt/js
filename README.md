# website

This repository contains the code for my personal website. This website mainly serves as a sandbox for me to explore and experiment with anything front-end (HTML, CSS), but in particular with JavaScript. In more particular, with THREE.js and D3.js, since I like stuff related to 3D graphics and data visualization.

I got the chance to have a pretty nice domain name:
