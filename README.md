# website

This repository contains the code for my personal website. This website mainly serves as a sandbox for me to explore and experiment with anything front-end (HTML, CSS), but in particular with JavaScript, but in more particular with THREE.js and D3.js.

I got the chance to have a pretty nice domain name:
